name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "issue/SHPLV-52-build-release" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "SHPLV-52", "**/SHPLV-52*" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "SHPLV-52", "**/SHPLV-52*" ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
